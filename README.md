# Async Chat Server

* This is an example project I'm doing to Rust to combat the messed up world of Tech Recruiting which demands that I have a brag board of a github full of hodge podge wasteful projects with very little solid impact on the world around me and could very well have been copy and pasted etc. Anyway, instead of spending time doing the rust book or any organized thing I've decided to take the Remzi Arpaci-Dusseau approach to CS Success and make real software.... and real tears. Anywho, I followed along with a video for this project so hire me at your own risk.
